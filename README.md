### A nice welcome script for Bash
This is a nice little script for your `.bashrc` that greets you on every launch, with some helpful (and customizable!) information.

My goal with this script is to keep it simple, just a single line that gives useful information when you start the terminal.

### Installing:
#### Via Curl
Run `bash -c "$(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/G2-Games/welcome-sh/main/install.sh)"` to install it. 

Run it again to uninstall.

#### Manual Installation
To use it, download `welcome.sh` and place it in your home directory. Then add `/home/$USER/welcome.sh` to your `.bashrc`

### Updating:
WIP

Currently you can update by uninstalling and reinstalling, but this wipes all settings. I am working on making a better way to do this.

### TODO:
- [x] Add easier way to install and update
- [ ] Fix issues across other distros
- [ ] Add features?
