# welcome-sh
### A nice welcome script for Bash (and zsh)
This is a nice little script for your `.bashrc` that greets you on every launch, with some helpful (and customizable!) information

To use it, download `welcome.sh` and place it in your home directory. Then add `/home/$USER/welcome.sh` to your `.bashrc`
